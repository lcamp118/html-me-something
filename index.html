        <h2>Zeus</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Zeus and I am a 6 year old Rottweiler mix. My mom and dad adopted me from <a href="https://kcpetproject.org" target="_blank">KC Pet Project</a>.
            I am their first rescue and let&apos;s just say they loved me so much they just had to rescue even more
            animals!!<br><br>
        Not only am I the oldest, I am the alpha dog. I hog all the toys, food, and attention. I am also the *BEST* guard dog
                ever!! I bark or growl whenever I see anything, whether it is a squirrel or a kid walking down the street with their
                family. No one sneaks up on my family!!<br><br>
        But don&apos;t let that fool you! I only bark to see if you mean my family harm. In reality, I just love getting attention
                from people!! And I love to give kisses!!</p>

        <h2>Nala</h2>
        <p>My name is Nala. I am a purebred German Shepherd girl that my parents also adopted from <a href="https://kcpetproject.org" target="_blank">KC Pet Project</a>. I didn&apos;t have
                the best start in life. When KC Pet Project found me I was living at a different &quot;animal rescue&quot; who didn&apos;t quite
                understand how to properly care for a large amount of animals. They often did not let me out of my kennel so I had no
                choice but to go to the bathroom where I slept.<br><br>
        When my parents adopted me, they knew it would be a long hard road to getting me to my best self but they didn&apos;t care.
                They brought me home and started leash training me immediately. It was very weird to have a collar on with this leash
                from it, but my dad really helped me learn how to walk on a leash. It took several months for me to understand how much
                better it is NOT to go to the bathroom in my kennel.<br><br>
        I am now 5 years old and very happy!! I love my pet siblings!! We like to run around and wrestle outside. My favorite
                thing is when my mom gives me an ice cube to chew on in the morning!!</p>

        <h2>Snowflake</h2>
        <p>Hi I am Snowflake! I am a White German Shepherd mix that my parents adopted from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FriendsOfKckAnimalControl/" target="_blank">KCK Animal Control</a>. When my parents
                brought me home, I was very scared. My parents do not know much about my history because I was a stray but they think I
                may have been abused as a puppy. I was very timid and wouldn&apos;t come out from the corner. Also, I am terrified of brooms
                to this day.<br><br>
        With lots of love and patience and help from my doggy siblings I have really come out of my shell. In fact, I love to
                jump fences and several times my parents had to chase me and my doggy siblings down the street to bring us back home.
                Once I learned that I need to stay within my yard, I started learning how to dig holes. My parents don&apos;t like that
                either. Otherwise, I am a quiet dog who rarely barks. I don&apos;t give kisses like other dogs, instead, I like to jump up
                and &quot;kiss&quot; by pressing my nose to my mom&apos;s lips. We do this every morning!!</p>
